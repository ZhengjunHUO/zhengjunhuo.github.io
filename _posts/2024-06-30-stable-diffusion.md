Stable Diffusion is a type of generative model that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate images. It is based on the concept of latent diffusion, which involves breaking down images into noise and learning how to recreate the image from the noise through training. The model is built using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other techniques.
The basic architecture of Stable Diffusion consists of three main components: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), U-NET (denoising architecture), and VAE (Variational Auto-Encoder). These components work together to create the final model.
CLIP is an open source text encoder that converts descriptive words and prompts into a format that the AI can understand and interpret. It uses a combination of a transformer model and a CNN to process the text input and generate a representation of the input in the form of a tensor. This tensor is then used as a starting point for image generation.
U-NET is the main "brain" of the image model, responsible for generating the latent space that extracts meaning from random noise. It is a type of denoising architecture that uses a combination of convolutional and transposed convolutional layers to process the input noise and generate a latent representation of the image. This latent representation is then fed into the VAE for decoding and image generation.
VAE is a way to decode and encode images from their latent space representation into or out of a standard image. It consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, which work together to map images to and from the latent space. The encoder network takes an input image and compresses it into a latent representation, while the decoder network takes the latent representation and expands it back into an image. Together, the encoder and decoder networks form a generative model that can be used to generate new images from noise inputs.
In addition to these core components, there are also several other techniques and technologies that are used in the implementation of Stable Diffusion, such as weight normalization, gradient clipping, and Adam optimization. These techniques help to improve the stability and performance of the model.
Overall, Stable Diffusion is a powerful and flexible tool for generating high-quality images, and has a wide range of applications in fields such as computer graphics, machine learning, and data synthesis.
